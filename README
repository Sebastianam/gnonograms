Each clue is a series of numbers which represent blocks of filled in cells in the corresponding row or column.  Each number indicates how many cells are in the block it represents.  Each block must be separated by at least one empty cell from neighbouring blocks.  The order of the numbers in the clue shows the order in which the blocks appear in the row or column.

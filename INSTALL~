    gnonograms Installation
    ---------------------

    To build and install gnonograms, type the following commands:

    $ ./configure
    $ make
    $ make install

    * By default, gnonogramsl will install under /usr/local.  The configure script
      can customize the prefix directory.  Run ./configure --help for
      instructions and other installation options.
  
    * You may need to execute "make install" as root (i.e. sudo make install)
      if installing to system directories.

    * If you wish to try gnonograms before installing it, you may execute it
      directly from its build directory.  

****TO DO**************
	Note that certain desktop integration  (such as being listed in an application menu) requires full installation.

    Once installed, gnonograms will be available

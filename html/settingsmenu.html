<li class="list">
<p class="p"><span class=" gui"><span class=" em">Colors ...</span></span></p>
<p class="p"> The colors of the filled and empty cells in setting and solving mode can each be chosen.  By default the colors are black/white when setting, blue/yellow when solving.  An unknown cell is always grey</p>
</li>
<li class="list">
<p class="p"><span class=" gui"><span class=" em">Font ... ==</span><span class="media media-image"><img src="media/Larger.png" height="24" width="24" alt=""></span>...and...<span class="media media-image"><img src="media/Smaller.png" height="24" width="24" alt=""></span></span></p>
<p class="p"> The font used for the clues can be chosen.  The size of the font affects the overall size of the game window on the screen.</p>
</li>
<li class="list">
<p class="p"><span class=" gui"><span class=" em">Resize==</span><span class="media media-image"><img src="media/Resize.png" height="24" width="24" alt=""></span></span></p>
<p class="p"> The number of rows and column in the grid can be chosen.  By default the number is a multiple of five but any number can be entered (up to 100 x 100).  The maximum practical size will depend on the size of your screen.  The font size is automatically adjusted to try to fit the grid onto the screen.</p>
</li>
<li class="list">
<p class="p"><span class=" gui"><span class=" em">Difficulty==</span><span class="media media-image"><img src="media/Difficulty-spin.png" height="24" width="24" alt=""></span></span></p>
<p class="p"> The difficulty of the puzzles generated automatically by the computer can be adjusted. A higher number makes the puzzles more difficult by producing a larger number of smaller blocks.   Unless <span class=" gui">Generate difficult games</span> (see below) is ticked, the puzzles produced are guaranteed to be soluble with only one solution and can be solved by applying logic to one row or column at a time.</p>
</li>
<li class="list">
<p class="p"><span class=" em">Use advance solver</span></p>
<p class="p"> This is selected by default.  The computer will attempt to solve the current puzzle using trial and error if necessary.  If this is unselected, then only pure logic applied to one row or column at a time will be used.   Many of the puzzles that are supplied with the program cannot be solved using simple logic.</p>
<p class="p"> This feature is useful when testing puzzles of your own design to judge whether they have a unique simple solution or not.  If they can be fully solved without the advanced solver then they do have a unique simple solution.   The advanced solver will solve ambiguous puzzles but will only find one of the solutions.</p>
</li>
<li class="list">
<p class="p"><span class=" em">Generate difficult game</span></p>
<p class="p"> Unselected by default.  Normally when generating games, only the simple solver is used to check whether the random pattern is soluble and of the correct difficulty.  If this option is selected, the advanced solver is used instead so the pattern produced may be ambiguous and/or hard to solve. It may take a significant amount of time to produce a large puzzle with this option.</p>

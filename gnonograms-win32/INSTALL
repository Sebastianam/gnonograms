  Gnonograms Installation on Windows
  ------------------------------------

  The program is distributed cross-compiled on Linux and is self-contained; you do not need to install it.
  Unzipping the supplied file "gnonograms-win32-0.x.x.zip" will create a folder "gnonograms-win32-0.x.x".
  Open this folder and run the file "gnonograms-win32.exe".

  You can remove the program by simply deleting this folder and the configuration file "gnonograms.conf" that is created in your home folder. This file and the puzzle files (extension .gno) are plain text files.

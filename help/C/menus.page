				<p>Undo the last move.  Sets the last cell changed to its previous state.  A history of up to 100 previous moves is stored.</p>
			</item>
			<item>
				<p><gui style="menuitem"><em>Redo(Ctrl-Y)...</em><media type="image" mime="image/png" width="24" height="24" src="figures/Redo.png"/>

			<item>
				<p><gui style="menuitem"><em>Pause the timer(Shift-P)...</em>
				</gui></p>
				<p>Pause the timer. Selecting this option again or pressing Shift-P restarts the timer.
				</p>

			<item>
				<p><gui style="menuitem"><em>Restart(Shift-R)...</em><media type="image" mime="image/png" width="24" height="24" src="figures/Restart.png"/>
				</gui></p>
				<p>Set all the cells in the "working" grid to unknown and stay in "working" mode. Resets the timer to zero.

			</item>
			<item>
				<p><gui style="menuitem"><em>Computer generated puzzle (Shift-G)...</em><media type="image" mime="image/png" width="24" height="24" src="figures/Random-game.png"/>
				</gui></p>
				<p>Generate a random pattern in the design grid and enter "working" mode. By default, the pattern generated is guaranteed to have a unique solution that can be found by simple logic looking at one row or column at a time.  Higher <var>difficulty</var> settings give patterns with fewer filled cells and shorter blocks that are harder to solve.  If the <gui style="checkbox"><em>Generate difficult games</em></gui> item on the Settings menu is checked then the patterns generated may be ambiguous or require more advanced logic involving two or more rows or columns at a time. These may take some time to generate for larger grids.
				</p>
				<p> An approximate measure of difficulty ("Score:") is given in the game information panel. Puzzles that can be solved with straightforward logic have score ranging from about 4 (elementary) to 20 (tricky).  Advanced puzzles could have scores ranging up to 50,000 or more depending on how long it takes the computer to solve them.
				</p>
			</item>
			<item>
				<p><gui style="menuitem"><em>Let the computer solve it(Shift-C)...</em><media type="image" mime="image/png" width="24" height="24" src="figures/Computer-solve.png"/>
				</gui></p>
				<p>Run the computer solver on the clues and display the solution (or partial solution) in the "working grid". You can choose on the Settings menu whether the computer should restrict itself to single row/column logic or use more advanced (essentially trial and error) techniques.
				</p>
			</item>
			<item>
				<p><gui style="menuitem"><em>Edit the puzzle(Shift-E)...</em>
				</gui></p>
				<p>Opens a puzzle editor tool. You can enter descriptive information about the puzzle and/or enter clues directly. This enables you to enter a puzzle for which only the clues are available.
				</p>
			</item>

			<item>
				<p><gui style="menuitem"><em>Trim blank edges...</em>
				</gui></p>
				<p>Removes empty rows and columns at edge of grid. This is mainly useful for trimming puzzles generated from image files.

				<desc>The settings menu controls the appearance and behavious of the program. You can change the following features:</desc>
<code>
The colour of the cells
The font used for the clues
The number of cells in each row and column*
How difficult the computer generated puzzles are to solve*
The location on the where puzzles are stored
Whether or not the "advanced" computer solver is used
Whether or not the the computer generates "advanced" puzzles
Reset all options to their default setting.

				<note><p>*These functions are also provided by the tool bar</p></note>
		</synopsis>

		<list>
			<item>
				<p><gui style="menuitem"><em>Colors ...</em>
				</gui></p>
				<p> The colors of the filled and empty cells in setting and solving mode can each be chosen.  By default the colors are black/white when setting, blue/yellow when solving.  An unknown cell is always grey
				</p>
			</item>

			<item>
				<p><gui style="menuitem"><em>Font ...</em><media type="image" mime="image/png" width="24" height="24" src="figures/Larger.png"/>||<media type="image" mime="image/png" width="24" height="24" src="figures/Smaller.png"/>
				</gui></p>
				<p>The font used for the clues can be chosen.  The size of the font affects the overall size of the game window on the screen and can also be changed using the "Zoom in" and "Zoom out" functions (see View menu).
				</p>
				<p>The default font is Ariel
				</p>
			</item>

			<item>
				<p><gui style="menuitem"><em>Resize ...</em><media type="image" mime="image/png" width="24" height="24" src="figures/Resize.png"/>
				</gui></p>
				<p> The number of rows and column in the grid can be chosen.  By default the number is a multiple of five but any number can be entered (up to 100 x 100).  The maximum practical size will depend on the size of your screen.  The font size is automatically adjusted to try to fit the grid onto the screen but the "Zoom in" and "Zoom out" may also have to be used.
				</p>
			</item>

			<item><p><gui style="menuitem"><em>Difficulty ...</em><media type="image" mime="image/png" width="24" height="24" src="figures/Difficulty-spin.png"/>
			</gui></p>
					<p> The difficulty of the puzzles generated automatically by the computer can be adjusted. A higher number makes the puzzles more difficult by producing a larger number of smaller blocks.   Unless <gui>Generate advanced games</gui> (see below) is ticked, the puzzles produced are guaranteed to be soluble with only one solution and can be solved by applying logic to one row or column at a time.
					</p>
			</item>

			<item>
				<p><gui style="menuitem"><em>Puzzle folder ...</em>
				</gui></p>
					<p> The puzzles supplied with the program are stored in "[installation directory]/gnonograms/games" and the is the default. However, this directory is not writable once the program is installed on the system (in "/usr/share")
					</p>
			</item>

			<item>
				<p><em>Use advance solver
				</em></p>
					<p> This is selected by default.  The computer will attempt to solve the current puzzle using trial and error if necessary.  If this is unselected, then only pure logic applied to one row or column at a time will be used.
					</p>
					<p> This feature is useful when testing puzzles of your own design to judge whether they have a unique simple solution or not.  If they can be fully solved without the advanced solver then they do have a unique simple solution.   The advanced solver will solve ambiguous puzzles but will only find one of the solutions.
					</p>
			</item>
			<item>
				<p><em>Generate advanced game
				</em></p>
					<p> Unselected by default.  Normally when generating games, only the simple solver is used to check whether the random pattern is soluble. If "Generate advanced game" is selected, the advanced solver is used instead so the pattern produced may be ambiguous and/or hard to solve. It may take a significant amount of time to produce a large puzzle with this option.
					</p>
			</item>
			<item>
				<p><em>Reset all to default
				</em></p>
					<p> Selecting this sets all the configurable options to their default values

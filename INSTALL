  Gnonograms Installation from Source Archive (gnonograms-x.x.x.tar.gz)
  -------------------------------------------------------------

  Requirements to compile from source:
  build-essentials package (libc6-dev, gcc, g++, make, dpkg-dev)
  libgtk2.0-dev (version >=2.12) package and dependencies
  libgconf2-dev (version >=2.12) package and dependencies  (unless using ./configure --nogconf option)
  valac (version >=0.12) package and dependencies

  Put the tarball in a directory for which you have read/write and execute rights.

  Extract the files from the tar.gz file - this creates a gnonograms-x.x.x directory.

  Open a terminal in this directory

  Type the following commands:

    $ ./configure
    OR $ ./configure --nogconf (to compile a version that does not use gconf to store settings)
    OR $ ./configure --help (to see all possible options)

    $ make

    This compiles the source code and creates an executable 'gnonograms'.

    Type ./gnonograms to run the program in the directory in which it was built.

    To install the program on the desktop:
  $ sudo make install

    * By default, gnonograms will install under /usr  The configure script
      can customize the prefix directory.  Run ./configure --help for
      instructions and other installation options.

    * You may need to execute "make install" as root (i.e. sudo make install)
      if installing to system directories.]

    * If you wish to try gnonograms before installing it, you may execute it
      directly from its build directory.

    Once installed, gnonograms will be available


  Installation of Gnonograms binary-only archive (gnonograms-x.x.x-bin.tar.gz)
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  This version is already compiled on Ubuntu 11.10 and is only intended to work on that distribution. It may well also work on other distributions with equivalent or later versions of Gtk+-2.0.

  Extract the archive in to a user directory and run the "gnonograms" binary from that directory.

    Gnonograms Installation from Source
    -----------------------------------

	Requirements to compile from source:
	build-essentials package (libc6-dev, gcc, g++, make, dpkg-dev)
	libgtk2.0-dev package and dependencies
	libgconf2-dev package and dependencies
	valac package and dependencies

	Put the tarball in a directory for which you have read/write and execute rights.

	Extract the files from the tar.gz file - this creates a gnonograms-0.8.0 directory.

	Open a terminal in this directory

	Type the following commands:

    $ ./configure   (or to compile from the C source $ ./configure --novala)
    $ make

    This compiles the source code and creates an executable 'gnonograms'.

    Type ./gnonograms to run the program in the directory in which it was built.

    To install the program on the desktop:
	$ sudo make install

    * By default, gnonogramsl will install under /usr  The configure script
      can customize the prefix directory.  Run ./configure --help for
      instructions and other installation options.

    * You may need to execute "make install" as root (i.e. sudo make install)
      if installing to system directories.]

    *If you wish to try gnonograms before installing it, you may execute it
      directly from its build directory.

    Once installed, gnonograms will be available

    Gnonograms Installation
    ---------------------

	If you have the Vala source package then you will need to have the Vala compiler installed as well as the usual build tools (gcc etc).
	Otherwise download the C source version.

	Put the tarball in a directory for which you have read/write and execute rights.

	Extract the files from the tar.gz file - this creates a gnonograms-0.8.0 directory.

	Open a terminal in this directory

	Type the following commands:

    $ ./configure
    $ make

    This compiles the source code and creates an executable 'gnonograms'.

    Type ./gnonograms to run the program.

    [To install the program on the desktop:
	$ make install  - not currently recommended - installer not fully tested

    * By default, gnonogramsl will install under /usr/local.  The configure script
      can customize the prefix directory.  Run ./configure --help for
      instructions and other installation options.

    * You may need to execute "make install" as root (i.e. sudo make install)
      if installing to system directories.]

    *RECOMMENDED:  If you wish to try gnonograms before installing it, you may execute it
      directly from its build directory.

****TO DO**************
	Note that certain desktop integration  (such as being listed in an application menu) requires full installation.

    Once installed, gnonograms will be available

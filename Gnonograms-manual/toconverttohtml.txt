To convert to HTML, open terminal in root directory and type "yelp-build html *.page"
Copy all the created html, [javascript] and css files together with figures directory into gnonograms/html folder.

For Gnonograms/debian dont copy the javascript files and remove the script clauses from the html (which should not contain any script anyway)

Also copy all the Mallard files and figures into the gnonograms/help/C folder if installing on a Gnome system.

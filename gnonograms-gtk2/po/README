Internationalisation
********************

To update the translation template (.pot) file and individual language (.po) files after changing strings in the program or adding additional (non-programmatic) strings that require translation (e.g. in desktop configuration file) to the "additional_strings" file, open a terminal in the po directory and run "./extract-strings.sh"

To add an additional language, add the locale code as an additional line to the file "supported languages", run the extract strings script.

Insert the translations into the resulting .po file, preferably using a PO editor such as GTranslator.

			<p>Set all the cells in the "working" grid to unknown and stay in "working" mode. Inactive when in "design" mode</p>

		<item><gui style="menuitem">Let the computer solve it</gui>
			<p>Run the computer solver on the clues and display the solution (or partial solution) in the "working grid". Enters "working" mode</p>
		</item>

		<item><gui style="menuitem">Computer generated puzzle</gui>
			<p>Generate a random pattern in the solution grid and enter "working" mode. By default, the pattern generated is guaranteed to have a unique solution that can be found by simple logic looking at one row or column at a time.  Higher <var>difficulty</var> settings give patterns with fewer filled cells and shorter blocks that are harder to solve.  If the <gui style="checkbox">Generate difficult games</gui> item on the Settings menu is checked then the patterns generated may be ambiguous or require more advanced logic involving two or more rows or columns at a time. This may take some time for larger grids.</p>
			<p> An approximate measure of difficulty ("Score:") is given in the game information panel .</p>
		</item>
		
		<item><gui style="menuitem">Edit game description</gui>
			<p>Allows you to enter or change the name of the game shown in the game information panel.  </p>

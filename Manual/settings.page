<p> The behaviour and appearance of the program can be controlled using <link xref="#settingsmenu"/> and <link  xref="#viewmenu"/>.</p>

<p>  Some of the settings can also be controlled from the <gui>Toolbar</gui></p>

		<p><gui style="menuitem"><em>Colors ...</em></gui></p>
		<p> The colors of the filled and empty cells in setting and solving mode can each be chosen.  By default the colors are black/white when setting, blue/yellow when solving.  An unknown cell is always grey</p>
	</item>

		<p><gui style="menuitem"><em>Font ... ==</em><media type="image" mime="image/png" width="24" height="24" src="./Manual/Larger.png"/>...and...<media type="image" mime="image/png" width="24" height="24" src="./Manual/Smaller.png"/></gui></p>
		<p> The font used for the clues can be chosen.  The size of the font affects the overall size of the game window on the screen.</p>
	</item>
	<item><p><gui style="menuitem"><em>Resize==</em><media type="image" mime="image/png" width="24" height="24" src="./Manual/Resize.png"/></gui></p>
		<p> The number of rows and column in the grid can be chosen.  By default the number is a multiple of five but any number can be entered (up to 100 x 100).  The maximum practical size will depend on the size of your screen.  The font size is automatically adjusted to try to fit the grid onto the screen.</p>
	</item>
	<item><p><gui style="menuitem"><em>Difficulty==</em><media type="image" mime="image/png" width="24" height="24" src="./Manual/Difficulty-spin.png"/></gui></p>
			<p> The difficulty of the puzzles generated automatically by the computer can be adjusted. A higher number makes the puzzles more difficult by producing a larger number of smaller blocks.   Unless <gui>Generate difficult games</gui> (see below) is ticked, the puzzles produced are guaranteed to be soluble with only one solution and can be solved by applying logic to one row or column at a time.</p>
	</item>
	<item><p><em>Use advance solver</em></p>
			<p> This is selected by default.  The computer will attempt to solve the current puzzle using trial and error if necessary.  If this is unselected, then only pure logic applied to one row or column at a time will be used.   Many of the puzzles that are supplied with the program cannot be solved using simple logic.</p>
			<p> This feature is useful when testing puzzles of your own design to judge whether they have a unique simple solution or not.  If they can be fully solved without the advanced solver then they do have a unique simple solution.   The advanced solver will solve ambiguous puzzles but will only find one of the solutions.</p>
	</item>
	<item><p><em>Generate difficult game</em></p>
			<p> Unselected by default.  Normally when generating games, only the simple solver is used to check whether the random pattern is soluble and of the correct difficulty.  If this option is selected, the advanced solver is used instead so the pattern produced may be ambiguous and/or hard to solve. It may take a significant amount of time to produce a large puzzle with this option.</p>

	<p>These options affect how the puzzle is displayed</p>
	<list>
		<item><p><em>Toolbar</em></p>
			<p>Selected by default.  Determines whether the tool bar is displayed.  Removing the toolbar creates a little more space for larger puzzles.</p>
		</item>
		<item><p><em>Grid</em></p>
			<p>By default, the grid is not displayed when setting a puzzle (to get a better picture effect) and displayed when solving. This option allows this behavious to be overridden</p>
